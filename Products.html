				<h2 >JackFish Client Provisioner<sup>TM</sup></h2>
				<p>The Client Provisioner is responsible for routing un-provisioned Mediaroom STBs to an RDP application which allows the installer to enter account information to associate the device with that account. This cuts CSR provisioning out of the loop, thus saving the cost incurred by that method. Additionally, this application supports automated device replacement scenarios. The module consists of an External Login Service (ELS) plug-in and an RDP self-provisioning application.<br>

				The Client Provisioner is a global application built on top of the Plant Framework that interfaces with the Microsoft Mediaroom system via published OSS/BSS web services. <br>

				The term global application means that one or more instances, depending on ELS load-balancing and redundancy requirements, of the Device Provisioning Module exist per install, regardless of the number of Mediaroom branches.</p>

				<h2>JackFish Client Upgrader<sup>TM</sup></h2>
				<p>Client Upgrader is an application that permits the operator the ability to schedule the upgrade of the client build on the setup box.<br>

				Upgrade programming is allowed on three levels:	<br>	

				<b>Device level :</b> This level is used to upgrade the client build version on a single device for one account holder.<br>

				<b>Account level : </b>This level is used to upgrade the client build version on multiple devices for one account holder.<br>

				<b>Group level :</b> This level is used to do a mass upgrade of a Client build version on multiple devices for multiple account holders at once.

				<h2>JackFish Billing<sup>TM</sup></h2>
				<p>The JackFish Billing Application is a global application that interfaces with the Microsoft Mediaroom system via published OSS/BSS web services. The Billing App is responsible for retrieving, reconciling, and publishing subscriber non-recurring (PPV/VOD/Application) billing records from a Microsoft Mediaroom system. Billing retrieval can be scheduled daily, weekly, or monthly and can publish data in a variety of formats.<br>

				One or more instances, depending on load-balancing and redundancy requirements, of the Billing App exists per install, regardless of the number of Mediaroom branches.</p>

				<h2>JackFish Grants<sup>TM</sup></h2>
				<p>Grants is an application for the management of subscriber rights for services, service collections, or packages and enables end users to access any of these resources.<br>

				Grants give end users permission to play, record, or pause assets and grants to be created for one or more subscriber groups.<br>

				Rights are dependent on whether the item is for a VOD, SVOD, RDP, DVR, PPV, SPPV (subscription PPV), or live TV service, service collection, or package.<br>

				Grants checks the access rights of the user account in the following sections; group level, package level and service collection levels.</p>

			<article id="prod7">
				<h2>JackFish Notice<sup>TM</sup></h2>
				<p>Notice is a notification service that enables service providers to send alert messages to set-top boxes, interrupting whatever programming end users may be watching. There are two types of Notification: <br>

				Level 1 alerts force set-top boxes to tune to a specified service, such as a presidential address.<br>

				Level 2 alerts display a message in a scrolling banner, such as a weather service alert that warns residents of certain counties that a flood warning has been issued. These alerts do not force set-top boxes to tune to a different service. <br>

				The alerts can be sent to just those set-top boxes in a particular geographical region. Alert messages can also be given a priority level, which determines the set-top boxes that display the alert. If a set-top box is tuned to a service with a priority threshold set, the set-top box ignores all alert messages whose priority is not greater than the threshold.</p>

				<h2>JackFish Caller<sup>TM</sup> </h2>
				<p>JackFish Caller ID Application is a light-weight, easily configurable software Application which provides a rich Caller ID experience to Mediaroom subscribers. Designed to be easy to use and administer, the JackFish Caller ID Application manages Microsoft Mediaroom integration, processing messages from a SIP v2.0-compliant telephony switch. Additional adapters are available to handle SS7 and non-standardized messaging sources.<br>

				The JackFish Caller ID Application is a branch-level application that interfaces with the Microsoft Mediaroom system through the Notification system. There are certain considerations that are managed which guarantee that calls to this system do not adversely affect normal Mediaroom operations and that Caller ID messages are presented to the subscriber in a timely fashion (within 2 rings).<br>

				The term branch-level means that a single logical instance of the JackFish Caller ID Application exists per Mediaroom branch. The only exception to this would be in the instance where multiple Caller ID sources are required to service a single branch. In this case, certain components, see below (Component Design), would need to be duplicated in order to support this configuration.<br>

				The JackFish Caller ID Application supports Microsoft Mediaroom v1.1 SP3.2/Client 1.6.4 and above. The subscriber screens (more detail in Interface Subscriber) are provided via Mediaroom Presentation Framework (MPF).</p>

				<h2>JackFish Remote PVR<sup>TM</sup></h2>
				<p>The JackFish Remote PVR Scheduler (a.k.a. R-PVR) extends the Microsoft Mediaroom DVR capabilities to allow for remote recording through web site portals and mobile phones. It provides remote management of scheduled and recorded shows. <br>

				The R=PVR is a global application that interfaces with the Microsoft Mediaroom DVR system through the OSS Remote Record web service. Supporting and enhancing the DVR system, R-PVR provides EPG search and recording capabilities. This functionality is supported by the import of EPG data to a central database independent of Microsoft Mediaroom.<br>

				The term global application means that a single instance of the application is installed for each instance of the Microsoft Mediaroom system. Two public facing web sites provide the portal capabilities for Mediaroom subscribers to search the Electronic Program Guide, remote record and manage scheduled and recorded shows: one web site for regular internet users and the other for mobile phone users. The current versions of these websites illustrate the use of the PC Website controls and Mobile Website control libraries; it is expected that the carrier will integrate with existing web portals utilizing these libraries.<br>

				For a remote record request, a mapping of user credentials to subscriber account is required to identify the specific subscriber and recording device. The subscriber is correlated to the account and branch through these end-user credentials. The current version of R-PVR utilizes authentication credentials stored in the CSM database, although different authentication schemes can be developed outside the terms of this version. Once the subscriber has been correlated to an account and branch, the remote record request is then transported to the specific branch for processing by Microsoft Mediaroom. <br>

				The JackFish Remote PVR Scheduler supports Microsoft Mediaroom v1.1 SP2 and above.</p>
